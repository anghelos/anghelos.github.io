           Quirky Aquarius marches to the beat of its own drum! The Water-bearer is actually an Air sign whose dual nature creates a unique, intellectual, and social individual who cares deeply for community and mankind. While Aquarius prefers ideas over emotions, their stimulating personality earns them fast friends. The worldly Water-bearer is a progressive spirit who’s focused on the greater good. When this rebellious sign isn’t satisfied with the way things are, they’re experts at garnering the support they need to instigate change. Ruled more by the head than the heart, Aquarius’ brilliant ideas and visionary plans inspire us all to raise the bar in our everyday lives.

           Here come the Gemini Twins, going a mile a minute! Clever and curious Gemini is a sign that thinks fast, communicates well, and is full of ideas. Their versatility and adaptability stem from their split personality -- part intellect, part scatterbrained! The Twins are powered by information and feel most at home when sharing thoughts and conversations with others. Gemini is like a sponge, soaking up as much information as they possibly can. Whether it’s through reading, talking, or writing, Gemini’s thirst for knowledge is constant. As the most talkative sign of the zodiac, the Twins are known to be social, and are always on the lookout for a good time. Thriving on variety, you never know what you’ll get with Gemini!

           Gracious, fair, and balanced Libra is among the most social and popular signs of the zodiac!

This sign of the Scales is blessed with a natural sense of right and wrong, making them very focused on justice, honesty, and fairness. As the sign of balance, Libra represents both the head and the heart -- they focus on logic and fact to ensure everything is on the up-and-up, but really thrive in the mutual feelings and closeness of one-on-one relationships. Beautiful both inside and out, Libra stands for harmony, elegance, and equality.
