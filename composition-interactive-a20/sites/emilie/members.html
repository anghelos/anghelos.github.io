            <p>
                RM is the leader of BTS and he played a big part in helping Big Hit form the group that fans get to enjoy today.It’s well known that that Jungkook was being scouted by the top entertainment companies and decided to sign with Big Hit after meeting RM despite the company’s smaller budget. RM also helped talk members out of quitting the band during their difficult trainee days.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He’s also a low-key genius with an IQ of 148 and taught himself English by watching episodes of Friends. RM is also a writer and producer for the band and has also put out two of his own solo albums titled Mono. and RM.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In their early days, RM struggled a lot with his identity as a musician. After his career as an underground rapper, he received a lot of backlash from the community for joining BTS. Meanwhile, he received a lot of criticism from the Korean music industry that he didn’t fit the beauty standards for an idol group.

            <p>
                Jin is the oldest BTS member, although he doesn’t often act like it. He’s known for his dad jokes, describing himself as “Worldwide handsome” in response to the times his pictures have gone viral, and winking or blowing kisses to the camera whenever it lands on him.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite being the oldest, Jin is one of the more easily frightened members. He can also be quite dramatic when he’s scared and it makes for a lot of great entertainment for fans on video content. He’s also one of the better cooks in the band and has a series of videos titled “Eat Jin” that focuses on his foodie adventures.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jin was originally studying acting and was infamously spotted on the streets by a Big Hit Entertainment staff member. Though he’s never formally acted in any K-dramas, you can easily see how natural his acting skills are in many of the BTS music videos.

                Suga is the second oldest BTS member and can often be found taking care of things for the other members.He’s known for being a bit of an introvert which sometimes leads people to wrongly believe his personality is cold. When actually Suga is very caring and sensitive when you get to know him better. The other members like to joke about how he prefers to help them without anyone noticing. And when he gets really excited his silly side will shine right through.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He’s well known for working long hours in his studio but when he has time off he likes to sleep as much as possible. Suga has been outspoken about his struggles with mental health in hopes to help others open up too. He’s also made many statements in support of the LGBT community despite the taboo topic in South Korea and has previously made personal donations to orphanages.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Prior to joining Big Hit Entertainment, Suga was an underground rapper and jokes that he was tricked into joining BTS when he initially thought he would just be a producer. He’s also spoken about his financial instability growing up and how he’d often go without eating when he needed money to take the bus.

            <p>
                J-Hope is one of the best dancers in the group, and also also a literal sunshine angel! J-Hope is known for being quite silly pretty much wherever he is because he likes to help others laugh and have a good time. If you watch him in interviews, he will most definitely introduce himself as “I’m your hope, you’re my hope, I’m J-Hope.” If you’re ever in a bad mood, all you need to do is watch some J-Hope videos and your day will get 100% better.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Although, he often takes charge when it comes to dancing practices and is very serious about perfecting their performances. For those that look up to his dance skills, he can actually be a little intimidating when he’s in dance teacher mode.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Other than dancing, J-Hope is known to love fashion and loves to go shopping. He’s not afraid to try different styles and loves having bags as accessories. J-Hope is also very caring of his friends and family, and even wrote a whole song dedicated to his mother titled “MAMA.”

            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Jimin had the shortest amount of time as a trainee before BTS debuted and almost didn’t make the cut. Although he’s a formally trained dancer, he had no experience with singing and had to continue to train hard over the years on his vocals. These days, he seems a lot more satisfied with his skills and has no problem hitting all the right notes live.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Jimin is perhaps one of the most affectionate members, towards his fellow bandmates and fans. On camera, he’s known for his strong stage presence, but offstage he’s often doubting himself as seen in their documentary Burn The Stage.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with being affectionate, he’s also extremely caring about the other members. If one of them gets upset on stage, Jimin is usually the first one to rush to their side to try and cheer them up. He’s always selfless and seems to constantly put others before himself.

                V, also known as Taehyung, Tae, or TaeTae was the last member of BTS to be revealed. He actually didn’t even mean to audition for Big Hit but had joined a friend for moral support and was convinced by a staff member to try out as well.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                V comes from a family of farmers and has said that he probably would have ended up doing the same thing if he hadn’t joined BTS. He remains extremely close with his family and greatly looks up to his father.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One word to describe V would be: unique. His voice easily stands out from the other vocal line because of his soulful and deep tone. He loves to play around with fashion and has a great appreciation for art as well. One of his favorite hobbies is photography, and he also acted in the Korean historical drama Hwarang: The Beginning.

                Jungkook is the youngest BTS member, also known as their Golden Maknae because he seems to be good at basically everything. Along with his vocal and dancing skills, Jungkook is also quite athletic and artistic.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Initially, Jungkook left his hometown at a very young age to take part in a talent show for kids and was soon scouted by several entertainment agencies. Like previously mentioned, he ended up signing on with Big Hit after being impressed by RM.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                He was also the only trainee that was sent to America for dance training prior to their debut. By the time the group did debut, he was just 15 years old. Since he left home at such a young age, Jungkook often says that the other members basically raised him and had a huge impact on who he is today.
