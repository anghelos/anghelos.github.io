            <h6>The weather is warming up, which means it's the perfect time to take a road trip. Just think: windows down, sunroof open, and nothing but open stretches of highway in front of you. The only hiccup is, you need to actually plan where to go.

                That's why Conde Nast Traveler editors have selected some of their favorite routes and designed a special road trip quiz to find the perfect summer adventure for you, that's if you happen to be in the U.S.A. that time of year. </h6>

            <h4>If you answered mostly A's: Big Sur</h4>

            <p>Sun, surf, and winding mountain roads—Big Sur is a classic road trip for a reason. The 100 miles of the two-lane Route 1 from Carmel, California to San Simeon offer ample opportunities for hiking, camping, and wine-tasting. But the drive alone is the big draw. Rent a convertible, put on your biggest sunglasses, and soak in some of the most beautiful ocean vistas in the U.S. </p>

            <h4>If you answered mostly B's: Route 66</h4>

            <p>Route 66 stretches 2,500 miles, from Chicago to Los Angeles. On this (mainly) open, flat road, you’ll pass through kitschy Americana landmarks like Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas; the ghost town of Oatman, Arizona; and the World’s Largest Ketchup Bottle in Collinsville, Illinois.</p>

            <h4>If you answered mostly C's: Florida Keys</h4>

            <p>For tropical-island hopping, fresh-from-the-ocean fish shacks, and key lime pie, pick up Route 1 in Miami and drive all the way to the tip of the continental U.S. in Key West. Along the way, you can visit Ernest Hemingway's home, go snorkeling in coral reefs, and hopefully spot the local colorful roosters that roam the streets.</p>

            <h4>If you answered mostly D's: The Badlands National Park</h4>

            <p>Driving the 30-mile loop through the Badlands National Park is like being on another planet. The landscape of mountains painted by layered sediment, jagged buttes, and ancient ravines full of prehistoric fossils is surreal. Break up your drive by exploring off-road, where you can see the parks legendary wildlife, including antelope, deep, and prairie dogs.</p>

            <h4>If you answered mostly E's: Blues Highway (Route 61)</h4>

            <p>Route 61 from Memphis to New Orleans is better known at the Blues Highway. Snaking alongside the Mississippi River, this route is a drive through American music history. Along the way, check out live blues at legendary hotspots like Beale Street in Memphis, Blues Alley in Clarksdale, and Preservation Hall in New Orleans.</p>
