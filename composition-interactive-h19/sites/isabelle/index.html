            <h6>Summer is the time for road trips. Whether it is by yourself, or with a group of friends, there’s nothing like driving across the country (or across your state), taking in the scenery, stopping in small towns to eat grilled cheeses and very large ice cream cones, and getting far, far away from your home. </h6>

            <h3>Best road trip planner apps to map out your adventure</h3>

            <h4> 1-Roadtrippers </h4>
            <p>As its name and slogan suggests, this is the only map built for travelers. This app will help you find virtually everything you could ever need along the way. Open Roadtrippers and you’ll find millions of locations, including local diners and roadside attractions that, admittedly, Google Maps is prone to miss. Then, once you’ve outlined your road trip plan, you can share it with your travel buddies so that they can make suggestions. </p>

            <h4>2. Waze </h4>
            <p>Like Roadtrippers, Waze hones in on social interaction, but it does so by letting the community decide which routes are the best to take. Users can report nearby collisions, police radar and traffic jams so that you can safely avoid those routes in favor of arriving on time. What’s more, you’ll find the cheapest gas prices around, as gathered by the community. Regardless of whether you set out to save time or money, Waze is the best way to do both.</p>

            <h4>3. GasBuddy </h4>
            <p>Unlike our previous mentions which can potentially save time or money, GasBuddy promises a specific amount of money you’ll save by using it. Similar to Waze, GasBuddy is a community-driven platform that helps you locate the most affordable gas prices around so that you never have to pay full price for fossil fuels again. The difference is that, with this app, you can subscribe to GasBuddy Pay for additional savings of 15 cents per gallon on your first fill-up and 5 cents per gallon on every fill-up after that. </p>

            <h4>Flush Toilet Finder</h4>
            <p>You're probably assuming rest stops will have you covered, but avid road trippers know how important finding clean restrooms on the road can be. Flush Toilet Finder is the easiest way to find a public restroom when you're in a pinch. This free app, with no in-app purchases, provides more than 190,000 bathrooms in a database that spans Canada, the U.S., and a long list of other countries around the world. This is the road trip, and general travel, app you didn't know you needed.</p>

            <h4>ParkMe</h4>
            <p>ParkMe is able to let you know how many spaces are left in a parking garage or on a street and will warn you when your meter or time limit is running low. You can even pay for a parking space ahead of time by credit card, so you're guaranteed a space upon arrival. Want to have your car washed while you're resting in the room? This must-have road trip app can help you with that too. </p>

            <h3>There’s more to life than junk food when you’re on the road.</h3>

            <p>Regardless of your destination, it’s important to savor the journey. Road trips aren’t just about getting there; they exist to inspire deep conversations, encourage the discovery of exciting landmarks, and allow for the exploration new places. It’s important to prepare as much as possible, which means stocking up on essentials. We’re thinking good friends, good music, and good snacks.</p>

            <p>It can become too easy to rely on gas stations and fast food joints to supply your road trip fuel, but let’s be honest: you want something a little more nourishing. To keep your heart and tummy satisfied, we’ve assembled some eating-on-the road advice, as well as some of our favorite road trip treats to keep your journey fun, delicious, and carefree. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Crunchy Roasted Chickpeas</li>
                <li>Peanut Butter Muffins with Chia Seeds and Chocolate</li>
                <li>No-Bake Energy Bites</li>
                <li>Gluten-Free Granola</li>
                <li>Fresh fruit, such as grapes, apples, cherries, bananas, and berries</li>
                <li>Mixed nuts, including macadamia, brazil, almonds, and walnuts</li>

        <article>

            <h6>The following are my tried-and-true products/clothes that I love and use whether it be for a week or two. Feel free to mix and match and take just what you want. I broke things down by climate so you can get a sense of what to take for the climate you are visiting. Enjoy!</h6>

            <h3>What Clothes and products to Bring </h3>

            <h4>Hot climates</h4>

            <p>5–7 thin and simple tank tops or sleeveless tops that can easily mix and match with different bottoms
                2–3 pairs of shorts of varying lengths. Avoid denim in humid countries, as it takes a long time to line dry.
                2 long skirts or dresses for conservative environments that require modesty — and they breathe better than pants
                2–3 pairs of light cotton pants and/or leggings
                9 pairs of whatever underwear you find the most comfortable
                2 pairs of thin socks
                1 pair of hiking or running shoes
                1 pair of flip-flops (jandals, thongs) or sandals
                A hat to cover your face</p>

            <h4>Temperate climates</h4>

            <p>3–4 tank tops for layering
                2–3 long-sleeved shirts for layering
                2–3 t-shirts
                2–3 tunic shirts or dresses
                1 pair of jeans or thick pants
                2–3 pairs of shorts of varying lengths
                1–2 pairs of leggings
                9 pairs of comfortable underwear
                4 pairs of socks: some for sport shoes and some for boots
                1 pair of boots or closed-toed shoes (wear in transit to save space)
                1 pair of hiking or running shoes
                1 pair of flip-flops (jandals, thongs) or sandals
                1 jacket, preferably something waterproof, for all occasions</p>

            <h4>Basic toiletry packing list includes</h4>

            <p>1 hanging toiletry bag for easy use in shared bathrooms
                Refillable travel bottles (shampoo, conditioner, face soap)
                Small container of body wash
                Facial moisturizer
                Venus razor refills
                Ibuprofen
                Travel first aid kit
                Toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss
                At least one deodorant
                Sunscreen
                Tweezers
                Makeup (if you put some on)</p>

            <h6>Going a road trip to explore nearby wonders and locales and is something that we recommend doing at least once in your life. And what’s one of the best parts of a road trip? The road trip playlist of course!<br> <br>

                We think a road trip is a great way to travel locally and to discover some hidden gems that are right on your doorstep. You might even become closer to the people who join you on the road trip (or you might as well since you’re going to be stuck in a car with them for an extended period of time!).</h6>

            <h4>Break up the rhythm</h4>

            <p>The best tip I have for putting together an awesome playlist would be to listen to some mellow music in the morning, then move on to top hits through the afternoon and onto some higher-energy songs in the evening. </p>

            <h4>Take everyone’s requests</h4>

            <p>When you’re on a long trip and you’re in the passenger seat, you could play deejay and take requests from everyone in the car. That way everyone gets turns at choosing a song and all music tastes are catered to. </p>

            <h4>Turn it off sometimes</h4>

            <p>Silence is great. Just being in the car and watching the landscape change is really satisfying. Sometimes it’s just nice to drive in silence and watch and listing to nature or the city your visiting when it’s summer and your windows are open. </p>

            <h4>How do you find the perfect road trip playlist? We turned to Spotify to help us!</h4> <br> <br>
