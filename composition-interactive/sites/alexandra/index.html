                        Scroll through your social media feed and you’re bound to come across images of seriously impressive, gorgeous nails.
                        Unfortunately, not all nail polishes are created equal. Some cosmetics companies still pay for unnecessary and inhumane tests on animals. These tests involve dripping substances into animals’ eyes, smearing products onto their shaved or scraped skin, or forcing them to ingest or inhale huge quantities of chemicals. After the tests are done, the animals usually are killed.
                        Luckily, having cute nails without harming animals is easier than ever, with Nailed it! products!

                        Business can be hard. Heck, life can be hard.
                        We’re all on a journey, and we’ve all been down in the dumps before, wondering if what we’re doing is really worth it.
                        Wondering if what we’re doing is really making an impact.
                        But, it’s important that we’re always moving forward. This is a lesson that I learned early in life.
                        I remember I was around 4 years old, and I was learning to ride my bike with my uncle and my father.
                        Of course, I fell off multiple times while I was learning to cycle, and I remember I one time I cut my knee pretty badly.
                        At that point I really just wanted to quit and go home. But, my family told me: “you can’t quit now, you’re almost there. Just try it once more!”
                        You’ve probably heard that before too, right?
                        So, I got back on that bike. I didn’t want to, but you just need to power through and face your challenges head on.
                        Sure enough, that was the first time that I rode that bike without any help.
                        After that, I was so glad I kept moving forward, and that I never gave up.
