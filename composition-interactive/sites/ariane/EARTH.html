           Perfection comes in the form of Virgo, the sixth sign of the zodiac. This hardworking, detail-oriented, and critical sign is represented by the Virgin for its pure and discriminating nature. Observant Virgo is quick to notice flaws and fix them, helping others reach their highest potential. One of Virgo’s strongest abilities is to take in a wealth of information, and pick out only what’s important and useful. This makes Virgo one of the most productive and efficient signs of all.
