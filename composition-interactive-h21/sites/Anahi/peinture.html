            <h1>HOME (series)</h1>
            <p>More than a house, it is a home. In this place events occur that will remain impregnated on the walls. Traumas, joys, light, fluidity, fears, disappointments. The objects in it are witnesses of the human presence and of the anecdotes that marked, mark and will continue to mark generations. Culture is one of many things that determines us, but when it is transformed so suddenly, its impact is even more important. We come from one place, but we grow our roots in another. Perhaps the mix of these forces confuse us and make us go through areas that are scary. To be clearer, perhaps I am referring to the fear of not knowing where you belong and what your identity is. But at the end of the day, this does not matter much, because we create a story and identity that is unique to us.</p>

            <h2>My Home</h2>
            <p>This is the entrance to my home. The most obvious limit between the inside and the outside. The high walls are helping the light going through the stained-glass window look majestic and its colors better admired. Although sometimes it is difficult to see the colors that the exterior can bring. I am there, admiring something unknown, something that does not seem, at first glance, To the place where I was born. However, I am calm. As long as I am at home, I can take my time. I am curious about what is out there. But I still do not have my coat.</p>

            <h2>Between me and myself</h2>
            <p>Maybe I was not seeing the landscape in front of me the whole time. I search for something in my reflection. But what? My expression does not seem to tell me. I am busy discovering my face, but I am also discovering something else. The window invited me to lean on it and to see through it, with different eyes. My two versions do not bother each other and live in harmony. Neither of them has seen the mess between the two.</p>

            <h2>Can you see?</h2>
            <p>I still look at myself in the mirror. What version of me do I want to see? My other reflection is ignored. I do not pay attention to my surroundings to concentrate on an idea with which I feel comfortable. I do not know what is important anymore.</p>

            <h2>It was an accident </h2>
            <p>The cut paper now decorates my house and never has. My home feels more like it when the art that I always love spreads before my eyes and the books become like parents for me, perhaps teachers, who teach me how to speak. The girl broke a glass jug spilling his precious red liquid. She looks up, with a worried expression, hoping she will not find her mother.</p>

            <h2>The dinner </h2>
            <p>Dinner is ready. This room is my family's favorite… I believe. At least it is always agitated. Table for two or four? Our eating habits have undoubtedly changed. Of one thing I am sure, I hated strawberries, but these are starting to seduce my palate.</p>

            <h2>Present perfect</h2>
            <p>Is freedom my present or my future? I have received so many things that I did not know before. Not being afraid can be one of them.</p>

            <h2>Bad news? </h2>
            <p>Has anyone unleashed their fury against the TV? The peace of this room was snatched by the sound of the phone. Is my family okay? We already made a lot of plans here; it would be a shame to have to go back.</p>

            <h2>From the eagle to the duck</h2>
            <p>The duck defeats the golden eagle, this sounds logical, doesn't it? At least that is what my economy tells me. People hunt ducks and not eagles for something ...</p>

            <h2>Inside, let us be</h2>
            <p>The door is always closed. The child, maybe a girl, maybe a woman, maybe they are two, hide inside their room. The door shows their interests, their creativity, their passions. A tree is growing outside their room. Maybe is just a plant.</p>

            <h2>Coffee at night</h2>
            <p>The city is my favorite landscape. Coffee, I do not usually drink it, but I want to stay awake. Or maybe I cannot sleep anyway? I love discovering the city of Montreal, sometimes I can see the colors of my childhood in it and people who understand me.</p>
