       <h1>Biographie</h1>
        <p>
           Anahi was born in Torreon, Coahuila in Mexico in 1997. At the age of 12 she moved with her mother and sister to Montreal. She fell in love with the city after some dark years of trying to adapt herself to her new life. From a young age she discovered her passion for the arts and after moving to Montreal the strong mexicaness that she could only see being far away. So, she decides to talk about her experiences and feelings of living two cultures through her art. She has a bachelor degree in studio arts from Concordia University.

       <h1>Artist statement</h1>
       <p>Currently, I’m working on a series of paintings that I named “home”. This project illustrates a Mexican styled house where I want to show myself living the Mexican and Quebecois cultures. The house represents me, the exterior the new culture that slowly mix with the interior changing the place. I want people to relate in any way with my work: Immigrants, people dealing with their identities or simply people knowing other people in this situation. </p>
